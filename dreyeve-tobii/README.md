# dreyeve-tobii
Visual Studio project that collects gaze over a random Dr(eye)ve sequence in a subset. 
Note that the gaze is acquired a posteriori and not during the driving task, as released in the dataset.

## Instruction.
Just set the `sequences` and `driver_id` variables (e.g. {1,2,3,4} and "david"), compile and exec.
