## experiments/actions

Code for predicting actions (`STRAIGHT`, `STILL`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) from the
multi-path top layer representations. For the purpose, an SVM is used.  

* [`action_utils.py`](`action_utils.py`)
holds some utility functions.
* [`predict_actions_with_SVM.py`](`predict_actions_with_SVM.py`)
is the main script.
